TAKE A LOOK AT MY OTHER RANT FIRST!

---

SYNTAX THEME SELECTION

---

In this rant you can set your theme for the syntax highlighter!
Just ++ the comment with your preferred theme.

The bot checks for the "<user> ++'d your comment!" notification and stores your selection!
(When you ++ multiple themes, your theme will be the one you ++'d the last)
Then, next time you request a syntax highlighting (see other rant on how to do that), that theme will be used!

Please don't post any comments here if possible!!!
(You can post comments and ask questions in the other rant)
Feel free to ++ this rant tho ;D

---

Have fun and thank you for using this bot!
