SYNTAX THEME SELECTION

---

In this rant you can set your theme for the syntax highlighter.
Just ++ the comment with your preferred theme.

The bot checks for the "<user> ++'d you comment!" notification and stores your selection.
So when you ++ multiple themes, your theme will be the one you ++'d the last.

Please don't post any comments here!!!
Feel free to ++ this rant tho ;D

Have fun and thank you for using this bot!
