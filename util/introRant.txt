SYNTAX HIGHLIGHT BOT

---

I have lots of ideas.
This was one of them.

Last week I was playing around with https://carbon.now.sh and found it quite cool!
Then I thought: https://carbon.now.sh supports Twitter. Cool. But what about devRant?
So yeah, then I got the idea: A devRant Bot that generates https://carbon.now.sh images!

Now, 4 days and 800 lines of code later, the bot is ready!
I even had to rewrite the notification checking code 4 times, because none of them worked perfectly...
But on the other hand, the final solution is so good that I want to keep it a secret for now ;D

HOW TO USE:

All you need to do is to mention the bot!
Example:

<rant>
@highlight
console.log('Hello World!');
</rant>

The bot then generates your syntax highlighted code (as an image) and posts it as comment a few seconds later.
Everything before the "@highlight" will be ignored!
Example:

<rant>
Look at this code:

@highlight
function add(a) {
  return a + 1;
}
</rant>

Here, "Look at this code:" will not be included in the syntax highlighted code.
If the comment text ends right after the "@highlight", the bot wont reply, btw.

THEME SELECTION:

That's not all!
You can even select the theme for your syntax highlighted code!
Just go to my other rant and read the instructions!
The theme will be used for every image the bot generates for you!
