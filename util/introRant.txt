INTRODUCING:

SYNTAX HIGHLIGHT BOT

---

I have lots of ideas.
This was one of them.

Last week I was playing around with https://carbon.now.sh and found it quite cool!
Then I thought: https://carbon.now.sh supports Twitter. Cool. But what about devRant?
So yeah, then I got the idea: A devRant Bot that generates https://carbon.now.sh images!

Now, 4 days and 800 lines of code later, the bot is ready!
I had to rewrite the notif checking code 4 times, because none of them worked perfectly...
The final solution is so good that I want to keep it a secret for now ;D

HOW TO USE:

All you need to do is to mention the bot!
Example:

<rant>
@highlight
console.log('Hello World!');
</rant>

The bot then generates your syntax highlighted code (as an image) and posts it as comment a few seconds later.
Everything before the "@highlight" will be ignored!
Example:

<rant>
Look at this code:

@highlight
function add(a) {
  return a + 1;
}
</rant>

Here, "Look at this code:" will not be included in the syntax highlighted code.

---

THEME SELECTION:

That's not all!
You can even select the theme for your syntax highlighted code!
Just go to my other rant and read the instructions!

My creator (and father thanks to @rutee07) will try to answer all of them!
